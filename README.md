Evidence classes follow
`bullet-farm/docs/release.md`; nothing in this repository is `LIVE_PROOF` or
`RELEASE_PROOF`, and every receipt named here is a component receipt.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/domain` | IDs, tokens, state machines, taxonomy; no I/O |
| `crates/application` | commands, materializer, leases/fences, pure simulators, `bullet demo`; policy loader (`policy_snapshot`, v1alpha1 + v1alpha2), launch-grant issuer and durable nonce store (`launch_grant`), signed lease-transport service (`lease_transport`), live-conformance orchestration (`live_conformance`) |
| `crates/adapters` | SQLite WAL ledger, checksummed migrations, and offline receipt-bound backup/quarantined restore |
| `crates/adapters-postgres` | configuration scaffold; implements no `Ledger` and never connects in required CI |
| `crates/harness-core`, `crates/harness-sim` | adapter trait, provider admission with two evidence-cleared blockers (`admission/`), PASETO v4.public launch-grant verifier (`launch_grant/`), lease-transport permit contract (`lease_transport.rs`), live-turn dispatch ports (`live/`), checkpoint-bound `PatchProposal` (`proposal.rs`), event envelope, argv/supervision gate, deterministic simulator |
| `crates/harness-egress` | Linux user+net namespace, `slirp4netns` uplink, in-namespace nftables default-drop, host CONNECT proxy, sealed `EgressReceipt`; see [`docs/egress-isolation.md`](docs/egress-isolation.md) |
| `crates/harness-{claude,codex,cursor,antigravity}` | fail-closed provider contract crates with bounded offline transcript/result subsets and one `LiveDispatcher` each |
| `crates/runner` | component-testable attempt loop; the CLI requires explicit durable UDS lease and Candidate admission (see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md#runner--farmd-lease-admission-refusal)) |
| `crates/verifier` | clean-room reconstruction and typed gate outcomes |
| `crates/effects` | effect broker and state machine over `LocalBareForge`, plus a bounded durable `PENDING` → `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` → `QUARANTINED` queue; the Jeryu adapter is a typed quarantine |
| `crates/router`, `fusion`, `behavior`, `projections` | non-authoritative scaffolds: routing fallback, fusion, behaviour catalog, spec §25 `View`/`Surface` types; the served §25 projections live in `apps/bullet-farmd/src/projections/` |
| `crates/mcp-mock`, `crates/test-simulation` | in-process mocks and harness tapes for the contract lane |
| `apps/bullet-farmd` | loopback-only HTTP + SSE daemon; routes in the table below |
| `apps/bullet-mcpd` | official-SDK stdio MCP adapter for fixed read-only farmd projections; no command or authority surface; see [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md) |
| `apps/bullet` | equivalent `bullet` and `bulletfarm` dispatchers: authenticated `auth`, `coding`, remote `mission` and read-only `tui` with separate Submissions; advanced `farm init\|backup\|reap\|restore`, `demo`, `demo-synthetic`, `mission materialize\|status`, `transaction --json`, `contracts generate\|check`, `authority keygen\|mint-launch-grant`, `provider live-conformance`, `run show\|print-preimages`, `dogfood read-only`; command details are in [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) |
| `apps/bullet-runner` | attempt runner with explicit peer/recovery and Candidate inputs; missing lease admission refuses. `--provider sim` is the deterministic simulator; `--provider claude` selects the contained read-only dogfood path and refuses missing admission. The generic signed-in path refuses before child launch with `SIGNED_IN_CONTAINMENT_UNAVAILABLE`; writable provider containment remains unqualified. Nonzero, unknown or timed-out runs preserve failed proposal artifacts without successful Attempt/Candidate promotion. |
| `apps/bullet-verifier` | product verifier boundary; always returns the typed `VERIFICATION_INTENT_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE` refusal without reading a job. The default-off `bullet-verifier-fixture` accepts unsigned fixture JSON only with `fixture-executor`; every fixture outcome is component-only, unsigned, non-independent, and transaction-gate-ineligible |
| `apps/bullet-effects` | no-argument component demo over `LocalBareForge`; `serve <durable-queue-dir>` processes one UNKNOWN job only to `QUARANTINED`, never fabricated forge success |

## farmd routes

Source of truth: the closed method-token catalogs in
`apps/bullet-farmd/src/api/routes.rs` and `api/portal.rs`. Each catalog token
generates both its Axum mount and the marked projection below; the docs lane
compares that projection and its explicit OpenAPI membership exactly. Anything
else answers the router fallback `NOT_FOUND`. `bullet contracts check` also
gates the generated client against the complete OpenAPI document.

No `/api/v1/leases/*` or `/api/v1/attempts/advance` route is mounted. Runner mutation
RPC stays off the browser API. farmd can load a protected durable peer registry
and signing key; Runner pins the farmd UID and socket GID and retains acquire
recovery in an explicit file. Missing lease inputs refuse with
`LEASE_TRANSPORT_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE`. Candidate admission is also required,
and serving dispatch selects only `sim`; no subscription Runner is qualified.

## Using Bullet: a step-by-step tutorial

This is the operator path end to end. Every command below was run on a real host; where
something does not work yet, this section says so rather than leaving you to discover it.

### What you need

- **Linux (GNU) on ext4.** The ledger checks the filesystem magic and the directory mode, and
  refuses anything else with a typed code rather than corrupting state.
- **A data directory you own, mode `0700`**, outside any repository and not under `/tmp`.
- **Node 22.23.2 and npm 10.9.8** — only if you want the web Portal. The pins are exact, not
  floors; a newer Node is refused. If you use `nvm`, `nvm use 22.23.2` provides both.

### 1. Start the operator console

The console starts the ledger daemon (`bullet-farmd`) on loopback and, optionally, the Portal.

```bash
# Only needed if your default Node is not the pinned version:
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.23.2/bin:$PATH"

cd <family-root>/bullet-farm
scripts/operator-console.sh --data-dir "$HOME/bullet-live" \
    --bullet "$(command -v bullet)" --farmd "$(command -v bullet-farmd)"
```

Passing `--bullet` and `--farmd` uses binaries you already have and skips a rebuild. Omit them
and the script builds from source instead.

The console prints where it wrote a **one-time bootstrap token**. It never prints the token
itself, and neither should you.

### 2. Authenticate this client

```bash
bullet auth login --stdin < <bootstrap-token-file>
bullet auth status
```

`--stdin` reads the token from a pipe so it never appears in your shell history or in `ps`.
Credentials are saved to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/bullet/operator` (default `~/.local/state/bullet/operator`).

If you are also using the Portal, pass its origin so the session is valid for both:

```bash
bullet auth login --farmd http://127.0.0.1:7420 --origin http://127.0.0.1:5173 --stdin < <file>
```

### 3. Open the terminal UI

```bash
bullet tui
```

**Keys** — the same list is always on the bottom bar, and `?` opens full help:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+K` | Jump list — every surface by name |
| `Tab` | Move focus between the list and the details pane |
| `j` / `k` or arrows | Move the selection, or scroll details when focused |
| `Enter` | Descend: mission → task → Attempt → detail |
| `Esc` | Back; also closes the jump list or help |
| `r` | Request one snapshot refresh now |
| `J` | Toggle raw JSON in the details pane |
| `?` | Help |
| `Ctrl+C` | Detach this client. Durable work continues; it does not stop anything |

**What the views show.** Mission Graph, Tasks, Session Supervisor, Merge Rail, Incidents and
Audit, and Context Lineage each read a durable ledger subject. The jump list also names surfaces
that have **no ledger subject yet**; selecting one is deliberately inert and says so, rather
than showing an empty table that looks like "nothing is wrong".

The view polls every two seconds. A status of `OBSERVED` means the snapshot is current;
`CONNECTING`, `STALE` and `UNKNOWN` are distinct states and are never rendered as success.

### 4. Open the web Portal

With the console running, open <http://127.0.0.1:5173>, paste the same one-time bootstrap token
into **Authenticate local session**, and you get the same ledger through a browser: Shift Brief,
Control Tower, Fleet, Session Supervisor, Merge Rail, Quality Lab, Context Lineage and
Incidents. Updates arrive over a live event stream rather than polling.

There is exactly **one local operator identity**. It is minted on first bootstrap and reused;
there are no user accounts, roles, or tenancy.

### 5. Put something in it

A brand-new ledger is empty, and an empty table is not very instructive. To seed one:

```bash
BULLET_DATA_DIR="$HOME/bullet-live" bullet demo
```

This writes one mission, two work packages, two attempts and two context capsules so every view
has rows. **It is simulator-sourced**: it never creates a Candidate, and it is not evidence of
anything. Treat it as sample data.

### What works today, and what does not

| | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Read the ledger from the terminal or the browser | **Works** |
| Live updates, typed refusals, honest `UNKNOWN` | **Works** |
| Authenticate, check, and revoke a session | **Works** |
| Submit a durable coding command | **Accepted and journaled**, then settles `UNKNOWN` — no execution adapter is connected yet |
| Approve, reject, retry, cancel, or edit from the UI | **Not available.** Neither surface performs these |
| Talk to the Head | Messages are saved; the Head does not reply yet (`HEAD_RUNTIME_BINDING_REQUIRED`) |
| Drive a real provider turn | Available through `bullet-runner` with dogfood admission, not yet from the UI |

This is an observation surface with a submission path whose executor is not yet attached. That
is stated here so the first thing you try is not the one thing that cannot finish.

### Troubleshooting

| What you see | What it means | Do this |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FARMD_REQUEST_FAILED` | `bullet-farmd` is not running or not reachable at the saved address | Start the console (step 1), then `bullet auth status` |
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | No saved credentials for this client | Run step 2 |
| `TUI_TERMINAL_REQUIRED: use --once` | stdin is not a terminal — you piped or redirected | Run `bullet tui` in a real terminal, or `bullet tui --once` for one plain-text snapshot |
| `NODE_PIN` / `NPM_PIN` | Your Node or npm is not the exact pinned version | `nvm use 22.23.2`, or re-run with `--bullet`/`--farmd` if you only want the terminal UI |
| `SQLite immediate state parent must be euid-owned exact 0700` | The data directory is group- or world-accessible, usually from a default `umask` | `chmod 700 <data-dir>` |
| Colours look muddy or wrong | The UI emits 24-bit colour | Use a truecolor terminal, or set `NO_COLOR=1` for a plain monochrome render |
| Everything is empty | The ledger genuinely has no rows | Seed it with `bullet demo` (step 5) |

## Quick start (build and prove from source)

```bash
just fast
BULLET_DATA_DIR=./target/demo cargo run -p bullet --bin bullet -- demo
```

Run `just setup` only if this checkout has not yet been prepared (toolchain
and repo-side dependencies).

The demo receipt is re-derived from ledger rows on every run and proves the
permanent fence advanced (fence 1, then fence 2 on the same variant), that a
stale heartbeat and stale token are refused, and that a lost SCM response is
recorded as an unknown outcome rather than a success.

The portal is a projection of this API. It is never an authority source.

Serving ledger opens retain a shared lock on the admitted database descriptor.
The current implementation supports the ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem family and
refuses other filesystems or exclusive-custody contention. Startup inspects a
private snapshot, with a 1 GiB input/recovery bound, before writable SQLite can
recover source journals. Authentic schema 22 returns `UPGRADE_REQUIRED`; it is
never migrated during serving startup. Backups read an owned recovered private
snapshot under the same source custody and preserve verified schema 22 or 23.
Custody survives publication, exact receipt read-back and confirmed source close.
Exclusive upgrades, durable backup/receipt retry and external authority high-water
enforcement remain unimplemented.

## Offline maintenance

```bash
cargo run -p bullet --bin bullet -- farm backup \
  --database ./target/demo/ledger.sqlite \
  --output ./backup.sqlite \
  --receipt ./backup.receipt.json
cargo run -p bullet --bin bullet -- farm restore \
  --backup ./backup.sqlite \
  --receipt ./backup.receipt.json \
  --destination ./restored.sqlite
```

Backup uses SQLite's online backup API and checks the exact schema, foreign
keys, and SQLite integrity before publishing an absent output; the thin CLI then
creates its separate no-clobber receipt. The receipt binds physical bytes and
integrity with BLAKE3; it is not signed and does not prove authenticity. A
receipt-write failure can leave an unusable orphan snapshot. Restore verifies
those exact bytes and the supported schema, preserves authority state, advances
the restore epoch, and publishes only to an absent destination. Success requires
read-back through a private verification snapshot; SQLite never opens the backup
source or published output names. The result remains quarantined: normal Kernel open refuses it
because no production authority admission operation exists. A directory-sync
failure after publication is an unknown outcome with a complete destination
possibly present. These are offline operator commands, not a live backup service
or an authority recovery procedure.

## Lanes

Every lane is one script under `ops/ci/`, reachable as `just <lane>` or
`bash scripts/ci-local.sh <lane>`.

The exact counts, filters and complete identity digests live in
[`ops/ci/inventory.sh`](ops/ci/inventory.sh). Standalone, host-dependent egress,
contract and family partitions must be complete and disjoint.

| Lane | Command | Contents | Evidence class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fast | `just fast` | digest-bound standalone partition with every selected identity executed and zero skipped, including explicitly feature-enabled verifier fixture tests; both Gitd binary variables are unset so product resolution fails closed | `COMPONENT_PROOF` |
| lint | `just lint` | fmt, Clippy, actionlint 1.7.8, ShellCheck 0.10.0, and inventory/workflow/observation/nightly meta-tests | hygiene gate; no evidence class |
| contract | `just contract` | exactly 34 offline provider-protocol and simulation tests, executed once; no sibling daemon | `COMPONENT_PROOF` / `SYNTHETIC_PROOF` |
| security | `just security` | gitleaks (no-git); `cargo deny fetch db` plus a lane-side freshness proof of the RustSec advisory database (refuses at 14 days); `cargo deny --locked check licenses advisories bans sources` against the committed `deny.toml`; `zizmor --offline --no-ignores --strict-collection .github`; a missing tool, a missing `deny.toml`, or an absent/stale advisory database fails | hygiene gate; no evidence class |
| docs | `just docs` | generated-contract drift, workspace rustdoc, and repository-relative Markdown links | hygiene gate; no evidence class |
| required | `just check` | fast, lint, contract, security, and docs sequentially, exactly once | unsigned component observation only |
| family | `BULLET_GITD_BIN=/canonical/absolute/bullet-gitd BULLET_GITD_SHA256=<lowercase-sha256> just family` | exactly nine connected family tests: five transaction-demo identities, three runner identities, and `synthetic_e2e`; missing, relative, non-canonical, non-executable, or digest-mismatched daemon subjects fail | family observation only; not registered until immutable family provisioning exists |
| offline transaction component | `BULLET_GITD_BIN=/canonical/absolute/bullet-gitd BULLET_GITD_SHA256=<lowercase-sha256> just proof-transaction-offline` | builds locked Kernel subjects offline, runs durable scope and Candidate authority through product Runner/production Gitd, fixture verification, exact Candidate delivery/read-back, stale-fence refusal, and `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` reconciliation, then retains strict JSON | unsigned `COMPONENT_PROOF`; fixture verifier; explicitly ineligible for transaction/release admission |
| audit | `just audit` | Jankurai audit against the committed ratchet floor (`AUDIT_FLOOR=57`, may only rise); artifacts under `.jankurai/`; a missing auditor fails | hygiene gate; no evidence class |
| egress | `just egress` | exactly three host-dependent live proofs, kept outside standalone by the inventory ratchet, cover namespace, uplink, nftables, CONNECT proxy, receipt, and teardown; exits 78 (neutral) when any of `unshare nsenter slirp4netns nft curl cat kill` or unprivileged user namespaces is missing; never green unless all three capability-admitted probes run | `COMPONENT_PROOF` on a Linux host |
| nightly | `just nightly` | per selected provider: exact live-feature refusal test plus guarded live-conformance half. All PONG is 0; any typed policy or runtime-observation refusal without a hard failure is neutral 78; any test, execution, or spawn failure is 1. Default mode uses marker executables and the checked-in policy, never a real provider | default: `COMPONENT_PROOF` of refusal without spawn; not `LIVE_PROOF` |
| toolchain-msrv | `just toolchain-msrv` | release-schema observation under Rust 1.95.0; separate from standalone required CI and still family-bound while its frozen receipt argv tests all targets | `COMPONENT_PROOF`; unsigned input to a future release receipt only |

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` scans source and lockfiles before dependency work,
then runs the five atomic lanes in parallel and converges on exact context
`CI / required`. Scheduled diagnostics cover external links, advisories,
coverage, full-history secrets, and macOS/Windows compile plus typed refusal.
All hosted observations are unsigned `DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY`, not Evidence or release
receipts. See [CI and test inventory](docs/testing.md).

## Readiness

| Surface | Current meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Component tests | Lease, ledger, harness, runner, verifier, effects, and protocol primitives |
| `bullet demo` | Deterministic ledger simulation only |
| `bullet demo-synthetic` | Offline non-gating scaffold; while production authority is unavailable, it exits failed with a typed refusal and no Candidate |
| `bullet farm backup\|restore` | Offline integrity/subject maintenance; restored truth remains quarantined |
| Internal command worker | Authenticated invoked reconciliation; demo work settles only `UNKNOWN`, unsupported kinds only `FAILED` |
| Provider contracts | Four bounded offline transcript/result subsets plus one common policy-gated live-conformance path; the checked-in v1alpha1 policy refuses at `POLICY`, while a valid v1alpha2 policy reaches the production adapters' typed `RUNTIME_PROBE_UNAVAILABLE` refusal at `ADMISSION`; both exit 78 before any provider spawn, and no provider has a live receipt |
| Policy loader | v1alpha1 and v1alpha2 (ADR 0012 mirror); live admission is legal only at generation ≥ 2 with an active `provider-runner` key; the committed fixture is v1alpha1, generation 1, live disabled |
| Launch-grant authority | Offline operator keygen and mint from the durable lease; the verifier binds lease, admission, policy, a single-use nonce, and the ledger's durable authority epoch/freeze generation; no admitted online operation advances those revisions |
| Egress isolation | Linux-only namespace/nftables/CONNECT-proxy boundary with a sealed receipt; `just egress` on a capable host, else neutral 78 |
| farmd projections | Six read-only §25 routes, each one atomic ledger snapshot with a sequence watermark; consumed by the Portal; never authority |
| Runner ↔ farmd leases | Explicit durable peer registry, signed UDS transport and file-backed acquire recovery; missing admission refuses; simulator dispatch only and no production profile receipt |
| Exact five-plane transaction | A family-only component fixture exercises the roles; the product `bullet transaction --json` returns typed `ABSENT` with exit 2, and no `TRANSACTION_PROOF` exists |
| Production | Not eligible; operator-ratified live policy, signed lease transport, durable authority epoch and budgets, online BulletGit authority, freeze, and restore admission are incomplete |

The product scaffold never selects Runner's private `#[cfg(test)]` workspace
simulator. That simulator covers repair-loop mechanics only and cannot produce
transaction, live, or release evidence. Until signed BulletGit authority is
available, the product receipt must preserve `AUTHORITY_CONTRACT_UNAVAILABLE`
and show no Candidate, Evidence, or effect.

The harness has one non-spawning `ProviderAdmission` evaluator. It requires an
absolute canonical executable and exact complete descriptor/version/capability/
profile/protocol probe; stages only digest-bound, individually allowlisted OAuth
files in a unique 0700 HOME as 0400 files; builds the child environment from a
positive allowlist; and checks canaries across environment, stdout, stderr,
events, and the accepted gate-ID-only proposal. Its deterministic receipt binds
those facts but is not authority. Every fresh receipt carries
`SIGNED_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE` and `EGRESS_ISOLATION_UNAVAILABLE`; only
`admit_signed` (a `VerifiedLaunchGrant` whose provider facts equal the receipt)
and `admit_egress` (egress evidence whose every probe observed refusal or
unreachability, including `direct-internet` and `host-jeryu`) clear them, and
`build_with_admission` calls `require_dispatch`, which refuses while any
blocker remains. A deserialized receipt never dispatches (`UNSIGNED_RECEIPT`).
Codex App Server JSONL, Cursor ACP, Antigravity structured headless with
1.1.19's flags-before-prompt-last-`-p=` ordering, and Claude stream JSON are the
frozen protocol requirements; runtime probes, not provider names, determine
conformance. No production adapter can yet produce the owned runtime and
conformance observation. Its default port returns `RUNTIME_PROBE_UNAVAILABLE`
immediately after a valid policy check and before operator-key read, Mission/
graph materialization, lease or nonce writes, egress, or spawn. The checked-in
v1alpha1 policy refuses even earlier with `POLICY_LIVE_ADMISSION_DISABLED`.
Only a strict `cfg(test)` application wrapper constructs positive observed
fixture data, so its PONG paths remain component mechanics, never live proof.

The four committed provider machines accept only bounded offline protocol
subsets: Claude stream messages, Codex App Server JSONL, Cursor ACP, and
Antigravity's one-shot structured result. Exact structured terminal output may
become a locally validated, unverified `PatchProposal` (schema 1: content-
addressed `proposal_id`, `producing_attempt_id`, exact `base_checkpoint_id` and
digest, preimage-bound whole-file operations, admitted `gate_ids`); free text
cannot become a proposal, narrative fields are never serialized to the writer,
and no proposal is Evidence or `VERIFIED` truth. Their `--features live` tests
are non-ignored refusal contracts that prove public runtime methods do not spawn
or create artifacts. Fixed installed-version or schema observations are test
inputs, not live runtime conformance.

The ordinary harness argv gate also refuses every known live provider executable
by default (`LIVE_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE`). Its bounded supervision and process-
group cleanup are component-level mechanics, not a provider dispatch path or
network containment. The authenticated internal worker likewise has no admitted
runner, verifier, or effect adapter: it can durably reconcile only to `UNKNOWN`
or `FAILED`, never `APPLIED` or `VERIFIED`. There is no admitted live provider
dispatch, online BulletGit call, independent Evidence flow, or
runner-to-verifier-to-effect transaction. The Jeryu adapter performs no
credential lookup or network call. No component test or synthetic receipt
establishes Transaction-ready or production-ready status.
