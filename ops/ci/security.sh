# The advisory database is refreshed and then independently proved fresh.
# cargo-deny 0.19.8 fetches it through the git CLI, and its capture() helper
# reads a non-zero git exit as success (upstream src/advisories/helpers/db.rs),
# so on a host that already has a database a failed fetch cannot fail the check.
# `maximum-db-staleness` in deny.toml does not close that hole either: a failed
# `git fetch` still rewrites FETCH_HEAD, so its timestamp looks current. The
# lane therefore reads the database's own newest commit. A missing, unreadable,
# or stale database is a typed refusal, never a skipped check.
