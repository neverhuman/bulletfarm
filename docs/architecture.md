## Ledger core

`crates/domain` is pure: ids, Authority Tokens, and the spec section 24
state machines. `crates/application` owns transitions, the `Ledger` port
(single-transaction lease acquisition, six-column heartbeat, expiry,
outbox), the pure simulators (`simulators.rs`; `crates/adapters` only
re-exports them), and the demo. `crates/adapters` owns SQLite (WAL,
`schema_version` migrations under `db/migrations`, typed authority tables).
`MemoryLedger` and `SqliteLedger` pass one shared conformance suite.
`crates/adapters-postgres` is a configuration scaffold: it implements no
`Ledger`, runs no conformance, and reports `NotConfigured` without
`DATABASE_URL`.

The current `AuthorityToken` is still an unsigned legacy in-process value, never
a mutation capability. Kernel typed ids are prefix plus 64 lowercase hex
(`crates/domain/src/ids.rs`), while the frozen wire authority contract still
requires different prefixes for some subjects. Lease and Attempt rows now persist
durable configuration/policy/routing/provider generations, authority epoch,
and freeze generation through a singleton `authority_revisions` row.
Grants now bind against `Ledger::current_authority()` rather than hard-coded
constants, so durable rows can evolve with policy and provider claims.
The kernel has an admitted PASETO v4.public verifier for launch grants
(`crates/harness-core/src/launch_grant/verify.rs`, below) and a quarantined
lease-transport permit verifier (`crates/harness-core/src/lease_transport.rs`),
but production authority remains an online gate: V1-S1 wire consumption and
normalized durable subject truth still need the remaining release proofs.
Until then, the online active-lease check is an observation only and unsigned
authority stays refused.

SQLite maintenance is an offline boundary. `bullet farm backup` uses SQLite's
online backup API over an owned recovered private snapshot, validates authentic
schemas 22 through 27, foreign keys and integrity, then publishes an absent snapshot; the CLI separately writes an absent unsigned
BLAKE3 receipt, so receipt failure may leave an unusable orphan snapshot.
`bullet farm restore` admits the receipt-bound bytes through a bounded no-follow
descriptor, preserves the supported schema and authority state, advances the
restore epoch, and no-clobber publishes an absent destination. It verifies the
published quarantine through another private snapshot before reporting success. That proves integrity and exact subject, not authenticity. A late
directory-sync failure has an `UNKNOWN` publication outcome with a complete
destination possibly present. The restored database remains quarantined and
normal ledger open fails until a future production authority operation admits
its restore epoch. Source custody and explicit source/restore close retain live
handles on failure; exclusive upgrade, durable backup retry and external
authority high-water admission remain open.

## Edge and contracts

`apps/bullet-farmd` is the loopback-only HTTP + SSE edge (`--bind` refuses a
non-loopback address). Errors are typed problem details with stable reason
codes; `/api/v1/missions/{id}`, `/api/v1/ready`, and the six projections carry an
`X-Bullet-As-Of-Sequence` watermark. The exact mounted route set is the table
in [`README.md`](../README.md#farmd-routes); the router fallback answers
`NOT_FOUND`. `contracts/openapi.yaml` is the contract source of truth for every
public route (the internal reconciler is deliberately absent from it);
`bullet contracts generate` emits Rust, TypeScript and JSON Schema models
together; `bullet contracts check` gates drift. Operator projections, commands
and SSE require authenticated durable sessions. Browser Origin and CSRF checks
remain enforced; operator-owned command and conversation discovery survives
local cache loss and daemon restart.

The read middleware (`apps/bullet-farmd/src/auth/read.rs`) checks an optional
`X-Bullet-Expected-Session` on authenticated `/api/v1/` GET/HEAD requests and
refuses a mismatch with `403 SESSION_CHANGED` before the handler runs. After
an authenticated handler returns, it adds `X-Bullet-Session-Id` and
`Cache-Control: no-store`. The CLI
request path (`apps/bullet/src/coding/http.rs`) does not yet send or validate
these identity headers; client owner-binding and recovery acceptance remain open.

Public `POST /api/v1/commands` returns the command's current durable phase.
Exact owned retries retain their original subject; they do not create another
command. `run_coding` task intent persists the accepted repository/base, scope,
criteria, gates, dependencies, limits, and server-derived task revision and run
tracking identities. Admission binds a request-digest nonce and quota
reservation so an admitted task may enter command dispatch. The observation
reports `CODING_BINDING_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE` only when that binding is
missing. This checks nonce/reservation records, not a complete execution binding.
`crates/adapters/src/sqlite/coding_tasks/admission.rs` creates no Mission/graph,
WorkPackage/Variant, or registered `CandidatePreparationSource`. The worker's
`CodingLaunch::from_task` (`apps/bullet-runner/src/bin/bullet-command-worker/child/coding.rs`)
derives a WorkPackage id from the command and puts the command request digest
in the Candidate-request argument. The Candidate-source consumer instead checks
its own typed canonical source digest (`crates/adapters/src/sqlite/candidate_preparation/source.rs`).
A coherent producer joining accepted task intent to those durable execution
subjects is still missing. Intent allocates no Runner lease or live provider grant.
The retired HTTP worker reconciler (`POST /internal/v1/commands/{id}/reconcile`)
authenticates and then returns `410 WORKLOAD_API_UDS_REQUIRED`; workload mutation
uses the separate internal Unix-socket boundary. Durable store and corruption
failures remain typed failures, never fabricated completion.

`conversation_message` atomically saves a complete human message, its owner,
server message/thread identities, command receipt, reference-only audit event
and head-turn request. A supplied cursor must match the current thread tip;
exact retries are checked first and return the original saved-message receipt.
`APPLIED` establishes this persistence only. Authenticated conversation reads
return complete, sequenced messages and a separate current-tip cursor from one
read transaction; earlier-history corruption refuses the read. The head request
has no Runner authority and reports `HEAD_RUNTIME_BINDING_REQUIRED`. No native
assistant response or delegated coding work is inferred from saving it.

## Projections

Source: `apps/bullet-farmd/src/projections/{mod,operator,fleet,sessions,context_lineage,merge_rail,quality_lab,audit}.rs`.

`/api/v1/operator-snapshot` assembles the operator surfaces in one SQLite read
transaction. CLI/TUI and Portal consumers validate its watermark and subject
relationships. This supplies a compatible board without composing independent
route snapshots; it does not authorize a mutation or certify live work.
The TUI's `Submissions` view (`apps/bullet/src/tui/submissions.rs`) retains its
separate command-discovery snapshot and watermark. It shows submitted commands
without inventing Mission, task or Attempt relationships or borrowing the
operator snapshot's sequence. Exact command ids and payload digests remain visible.

`/api/v1/fleet`, `/api/v1/sessions`, `/api/v1/context-lineage`, `/api/v1/merge-rail`,
`/api/v1/quality-lab`, and `/api/v1/audit` are read-only spec §25 surfaces. Each route performs exactly one
atomic ledger snapshot (`read_snapshot`) and returns the standard envelope with
its `as_of_sequence`, so a response never mixes two ledger states. Label
tallies are `LabelCount` rows built by `count_labels` against a complete
catalog: every catalog label is listed with its count, so a zero is explicit
rather than absent, and observed labels outside the catalog are appended
rather than dropped. An empty set is zero rows verified at a sequence, never a
healthy default. Earlier Portal component receipts (Kernel `529bad1`, Portal
`95108e3`) cover the five original routes and predate Context Lineage; they do
not establish six-route coverage. The current six-route inventory comes from
the source catalog. These projections change no authority or release decision. `crates/
projections` holds only the §25 `View`/`Surface` types (a failed read is
`unknown`, never an empty list) and stays non-gating.

## Provider harness

`crates/harness-core` defines the adapter trait, capability matrix, event
envelope, central `ProviderAdmission`, and supervised argv boundary. Admission
compares one absolute canonical executable against its exact BLAKE3 digest and
fresh runtime-probe snapshot (complete `HarnessDescriptor`, verified version and
profile, capability digest, and protocol). It creates a unique 0700 HOME, copies
only exact policy-listed OAuth files after digest and symlink checks as 0400,
and constructs a child environment from locale hints plus HOME/TMPDIR/XDG paths.
Host PATH, SCM, cloud, SSH, and API secrets are not inherited. Canary scanning
covers that environment plus complete stdout, stderr, normalized events, and the
validated `PatchProposal`; proposal text supplies `gate_ids`, never commands.

The local conformance receipt (`ProviderConformanceReceipt`) binds the exact
probe, environment, credentials, output/event/proposal digests, and every
blocker, and verifies its own domain-separated digest. It can never authorize
dispatch by itself: a deserialized receipt's `require_dispatch` always refuses
(`PROVIDER_ADMISSION_BLOCKED`, or `UNSIGNED_RECEIPT` when no blocker remains).
Only a live `EvaluatedAdmission` that cleared every blocker with its own
evidence (next section) can reach `ArgvBuilder::build_with_admission`, which
also refuses an argv executable that differs from the admitted one. Runtime
probes must show Claude stream JSON, Codex App Server JSONL, Cursor ACP, or
Antigravity structured headless mode with 1.1.19's flags before a prompt-last
`-p=`. No claim of network containment follows from environment filtering; it
follows only from an admitted egress receipt.

The four provider crates expose pure, bounded offline transcript/result machines
plus blocked public runtime surfaces: Claude stream messages, Codex App Server
JSONL, Cursor ACP, and an Antigravity one-shot structured result. They correlate
protocol subjects and accept a `PatchProposal` only from exact structured
terminal output. `PatchProposal` (`crates/harness-core/src/proposal.rs`, schema
1) carries a content-addressed `proposal_id`, `producing_attempt_id`, the exact
`base_checkpoint_id` and `base_checkpoint_digest`, preimage-bound whole-file
`operations` (`Absent` or exact digest; `Write` or `Delete`), and ordered
admitted `gate_ids`; narrative fields are retained for review only and are
never serialized to the writer. Free text is never authority, and a proposal is
not Evidence. Their feature-gated tests are non-ignored refusal contracts, not
live smokes or runtime conformance. Installed-version and schema observations
only freeze test inputs. Their shared `LiveDispatcher` observation port defaults
to `RUNTIME_PROBE_UNAVAILABLE`; no production adapter overrides it. The owned
observation type validates a proposal but is neither signed proof nor authority.
Only the application's strict `cfg(test)` Claude wrapper constructs positive
runtime/profile/event/proposal fixture data. All raw provider frames use strict recursive decoding
that rejects decoded-equivalent duplicate object keys and trailing data; Codex
applies it again to its inner proposal text. RFC 8785 identity is enforced only
on the launch-grant, lease-transport, and policy paths (`launch_grant/canonical.rs`,
vendored and golden-vector-pinned to bullet-wire). Production native lifecycle,
account/model binding and receipt qualification remain incomplete.

The argv boundary additionally enforces the kill switch
(`BULLET_PROVIDER_KILL=1`), worktree/tmux deny list, exact admitted executable,
and default refusal of live provider programs (`LIVE_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE`).
Supervision records exit/crash, cancellation, heartbeat loss, or deadline and
kills the POSIX process group before bounded pipe reaping. This is the Linux V1
process-tree mechanism, not a cross-platform sandbox. `crates/harness-sim` is
the deterministic simulator. Harness-core supervision is tested as a component.
The live-conformance spawn at step 11 below is unreachable under the committed
policy. Generic signed-in Runner selectors `codex`, `cursor`, `agy` and
`antigravity` all refuse with `SIGNED_IN_CONTAINMENT_UNAVAILABLE`
(`apps/bullet-runner/src/signed_in_cli.rs`). After argv validation, construction
refuses before Candidate/lease admission or workspace creation; direct `start`
and `send` also refuse. A worker-launched Runner uses the same boundary.
Claude uses the separate `DogfoodClaudeAdapter` and `dispatch_dogfood_compose`
(`crates/application/src/{dogfood_adapter,dogfood_run}.rs`). That compose requires
its policy, enrollment, credential/filesystem profile and egress preparation,
mounts the clone read-only, and admits only `Read,Glob,Grep` in plan mode
(`crates/harness-claude/src/dogfood.rs`). It is not an admitted coding workcell.
Native lifecycle, subscription execution and the full coding transaction remain unqualified.

## Signed launch-grant admission

Source: `crates/harness-core/src/launch_grant/` (claims, keys, key file,
expectation, nonce port, verifier), `crates/application/src/launch_grant/`
(issuer, durable nonce store), `crates/harness-core/src/admission/signed.rs`
(blocker clearing), `crates/application/src/policy_snapshot{.rs,/keys.rs,/live.rs,/load.rs}`
(policy loader).

**Token.** A launch grant is a PASETO v4.public token (`pasetors`) over the RFC
8785 encoding of `LaunchGrantClaims`, with canonical footer
`{schema_version, issuer, key_id, purpose: "launch-grant-signing"}` and implicit
assertion `bullet-farm.launch-grant.v1alpha1`. Audience is `provider-runner`,
operation `launch-provider`, TTL at most 15 000 ms, 1..=16 unique `gat_` gate
ids, every integer at most 2^53−1, every digest 64 lowercase hex, and the
executable path absolute, normalized, and control-free. Shape validity is not
authority.

**Issuer** (`LedgerLaunchGrantIssuer`, `bullet authority mint-launch-grant`,
and step 5 below). Every lease-binding claim is read from the durable active
lease inside the coherent lease check (`durable_lease_binding`: attempt row,
lease row with matching attempt and fence, `check_active_lease`, owning
graph); the caller supplies only the evaluated provider facts, sandbox and
environment digests, gates, and budgets. A single-use nonce is persisted with
its Attempt, fence, and expiry before signing. The operator key lives at
`<data-dir>/authority/launch-grant.key`: 64 raw bytes, 0600, self-owned,
never a symlink, never overwritten, Unix only.

**Verifier** (`verify_launch_grant`), in order: envelope framing and digest;
signature, footer, and implicit assertion under the policy-selected key;
strict canonical claim decode and shape; `LaunchGrantExpectation::check_subject`
comparing 21 string and 6 integer fields for equality with the durable lease
(`mission_id`, `repository_id`, `graph_revision_id`, `work_package_id`,
`variant_id`, `attempt_id`, `runner_id`, `workspace_id`,
`workspace_nonce_digest`, `attempt_fence`, `runner_epoch`, `authority_epoch`,
`freeze_generation`), the evaluated admission (`provider`, `adapter`,
`provider_profile_id`, `model`, `protocol`, `executable_path`,
`executable_digest`, `descriptor_digest`, `capability_digest`,
`sandbox_manifest_digest`, `environment_digest`, `credential_generation`),
and the loaded policy (`policy_snapshot_digest`, `policy_generation`); the
window `not_before <= now < expires_at`; `policy.live_admission_enabled`,
else `POLICY_LIVE_ADMISSION_DISABLED`; and finally the only side effect, nonce
consumption (`Consumed`; `Replayed` is `LAUNCH_GRANT_REPLAYED`; `Expired`;
`Unknown` when never registered for that Attempt). Nothing is consumed unless
every earlier check passed, and the first mismatch is reported by field name
(`LAUNCH_GRANT_SUBJECT_MISMATCH`). `VerifiedLaunchGrant` cannot be cloned,
serialized, or constructed elsewhere.

**Blockers.** `ProviderAdmission::prepare` starts every receipt with
`SIGNED_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE` and `EGRESS_ISOLATION_UNAVAILABLE`, adding
`PROTOCOL_NONCONFORMANT` or `CAPABILITY_NONCONFORMANT` when the probe misses
the frozen requirement. Exactly one path clears each:

- `admit_signed(VerifiedLaunchGrant)` clears `SIGNED_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE`
  after eight claim fields equal the receipt: `provider`, `executable_path`,
  `executable_digest`, `descriptor_digest`, `capability_digest`,
  `provider_profile_id`, `protocol`, and a freshly recomputed
  `environment_digest` of the staged child environment. The receipt is
  re-verified, a second admission is refused, and the non-secret
  `SignedAuthorityRecord` (grant id, key, issuer, envelope digest, expiry) is
  sealed into the receipt.
- `admit_egress(EgressIsolationEvidence)` clears `EGRESS_ISOLATION_UNAVAILABLE`
  when the three digests are 64 hex, 1..=32 uniquely named lowercase probes are
  present including `REQUIRED_EGRESS_PROBES = ["direct-internet", "host-jeryu"]`,
  and every probe observed `Refused` or `Unreachable` (`Reached` or `Unknown`
  refuse). See [`egress-isolation.md`](egress-isolation.md).

`require_dispatch` re-verifies the receipt digest and refuses while any
blocker remains; it is the final admission chokepoint on this conformance path.

**Policy loader** (committed `0d848f6`, mirroring hub ADR 0012). `load_policy`
admits `BULLET_POLICY_PATH` (absolute) or `<data-dir>/policy/policy.json`: a
regular non-symlink file at most 256 KiB, identity-checked between stat and
open (`POLICY_UNAVAILABLE` otherwise); the bytes must be canonical RFC 8785
(`NON_CANONICAL_POLICY`). `validate_policy` accepts `schema_version`
`v1alpha1` or `v1alpha2` on the snapshot; nested policies and every
`IssuerKeyV1` must be `v1alpha1` (`UNSUPPORTED_POLICY_SCHEMA`). It requires an
ordered window, generation ≥ 1, ≥ 1 issuer key, and 64-hex bundle/registry
hashes (`INVALID_POLICY_WINDOW`); issuer-key lifecycle and key-use rules
(`INVALID_ISSUER_KEY_LIFECYCLE`, `INVALID_AUTHORITY_PUBLIC_KEY`,
`INVALID_RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `INVALID_KEY_USE`); and the immutable
conservatism set, checked before any live rule so nothing can be traded for it
(`UNSAFE_POLICY`): lease TTL ≤ 15 s, no headroom from unknown quota, no
arbitrary shell gates, author evidence never independent, unknown never
satisfies a gate, R2 requires a sealed holdout, universal incumbent `T0`, no
evolutionary authority. `sandbox_policy.live_admission_enabled = true` is
`UNSAFE_POLICY` under v1alpha1; under v1alpha2 (`policy_snapshot/live.rs`) it
is legal only at `policy_generation >= LIVE_ADMISSION_MIN_GENERATION = 2`
(`LIVE_ADMISSION_REQUIRES_GENERATION`) with an unrevoked `authority-signing` /
`paseto-v4.public` key admitted for `provider-runner` overlapping the window
(`LIVE_ADMISSION_REQUIRES_RUNNER_KEY`). `validate_at(now)` adds the instant
checks (`POLICY_NOT_ACTIVE`; `LIVE_ADMISSION_REQUIRES_RUNNER_KEY` when no
qualifying key is active at `now`), with activation inclusive and expiry and
revocation exclusive. `authority_key_at` resolves `(issuer, key_id)` for an
audience only inside the window and only for an active, unrevoked
authority-signing PASETO key (`LAUNCH_GRANT_KEY_UNKNOWN`). The committed
fixture `crates/application/tests/fixtures/policy-v1alpha1.json` is
generation 1 with live admission disabled, so `require_live_admission` and the
verifier both end in `POLICY_LIVE_ADMISSION_DISABLED` naming the generation and
field; the v1alpha2 fixture is test data, not an operator ratification.
Equivalence with bullet-wire is pinned by `crates/application/tests/policy_v1alpha2.rs`
because the Kernel takes no path dependency on the hub.

## Live-conformance path

Source: `crates/application/src/live_conformance/{mod,steps}.rs`; ports in
`crates/harness-core/src/live/`; CLI entry `bullet provider live-conformance`
(flags in [`cli.md`](cli.md)).

`run_live_conformance` drives 13 ordered steps (`LiveStep::ALL`); each records
`PASS`, `REFUSED`, `FAILED`, or `NOT_RUN`, and a step that never ran is
`NOT_RUN`, never omitted:

1. `POLICY` — `require_live_admission`, then `validate_at(now)`. The committed
   v1alpha1 policy refuses here (`REFUSED`, outcome `REFUSED`, CLI exit 78)
   before any key read, runtime observation, namespace, or spawn; a live-enabled v1alpha2
   policy that is not active with an active `provider-runner` key at `now`
   fails here instead.
   Immediately after this pass, the application requests an independently
   observed runtime/conformance subject. If unavailable, the existing
   `ADMISSION` record becomes `REFUSED` with `RUNTIME_PROBE_UNAVAILABLE`; all
   other 11 records, including schema-earlier `OPERATOR_KEY` and `LEASE`, stay
   `NOT_RUN`. This early safety check preserves the frozen 13-step schema.
2. `OPERATOR_KEY` — load the 0600 key; `authority_key_at` must admit it and
   the public halves must be equal.
3. `LEASE` — materialize a deterministic conformance Mission/graph from the
   seed and acquire a durable lease (TTL 15 s).
4. `ADMISSION` — consume the already obtained owned runtime/conformance
   observation in `ProviderAdmission::prepare`/`finalize`, with fresh canaries
   and an empty credential set. No production adapter can supply that
   observation today. The fixed descriptor/profile/two-event/one-operation
   subject exists only in the strict `cfg(test)` dispatcher wrapper.
5. `MINT` — `LedgerLaunchGrantIssuer::mint` binding the durable lease, the
   receipt's digests, the egress backend's `sandbox_manifest_digest`
   (`EgressPolicy::allowlist_digest` for the real backend), and the staged
   child `environment_digest`.
6. `VERIFY_GRANT` — re-digest the executable, re-read the durable lease
   binding, `verify_launch_grant`, consume the nonce through the ledger.
7. `ADMIT_SIGNED` — clear `SIGNED_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE`.
8. `EGRESS_PREPARE` — `EgressBackend::prepare` (the CLI always wires the real
   `bullet-harness-egress` backend; `agy` maps to the `antigravity`
   allowlist); record the three egress digests.
9. `ADMIT_EGRESS` — clear `EGRESS_ISOLATION_UNAVAILABLE`.
10. `REQUIRE_DISPATCH` — the final chokepoint.
11. `DISPATCH` — exactly one read-only turn of `CONFORMANCE_PROMPT`
    (`Reply with the single word PONG and nothing else.`) through the sandbox
    command factory; the only provider spawn on the path.
12. `CANARY_SCAN` — a `SECRET_CANARY_EXPOSURE` from dispatch is attributed
    here.
13. `PONG_MATCH` — the trimmed response equals `PONG`; otherwise
    `PONG_MISMATCH` with outcome `FAILED`.

Receipt (`LiveConformanceReceipt`, schema `bullet.live-conformance.v1`,
sealed by a domain-separated BLAKE3 `receipt_id`): `provider`, `outcome`
(`PONG` | `REFUSED` | `FAILED`), `refusal_reason`, `failed_step`, all 13
`steps`, `executable_path`, `executable_blake3`, `grant_id`,
`grant_envelope_digest`, `egress_receipt_digest`, `egress_ruleset_digest`,
`egress_allowlist_digest`, `policy_snapshot_digest`, `policy_generation`,
`prompt`, `prompt_blake3`, `response_text`, `pong_match`, `cost_micro_usd`,
`duration_ms`, `exit_code`, `native_session_id`, `events`, `stdout_blake3`,
`stderr_blake3`, `events_blake3`, `started_at`, `completed_at`. Fields for
steps that did not run are `null`. It is written fsync'd to
`<data-dir>/live/<provider>-<utc>.json` on every outcome, including refusal
and failure.

Evidence class: the workspace test run drives this path through a fake
provider process, the strict `cfg(test)` observation wrapper, and the no-op
egress double (`live_conformance/egress.rs`, `test-seams` only, never wired
into the CLI); that is `COMPONENT_PROOF`.
`ops/ci/nightly.sh` default mode is `COMPONENT_PROOF` of refusal without spawn.
Every current product adapter refuses at runtime observation under an otherwise
valid v1alpha2 policy. No provider has a real-mode receipt; a future real-mode `PONG` would be
provider-conformance evidence for one read-only turn, not `LIVE_PROOF` of the
exact-subject transaction.

## Process boundaries

`crates/runner` (`apps/bullet-runner`) runs the attempt loop: scope check,
heartbeat self-fence, checkpoint journal, and `bullet-gitd` supervision; the
binary selects the provider explicitly: `sim` is the deterministic
simulator and `claude` selects the separately admitted read-only compose above.
The other provider selectors refuse unsupported containment; missing real-provider
inputs never select the simulator. Since `ca380bc` the runner's `Capsule`
carries the producing Attempt and the daemon-issued base checkpoint id and
digest; `pre_apply_refusal` refuses a proposal whose `producing_attempt_id`,
`base_checkpoint_id`, or `base_checkpoint_digest` differs from the active
capsule (`proposal_binding_refused`) before the workspace port is called, and
a successful `apply_proposal` advances the capsule to the daemon's new
checkpoint. `crates/verifier` (`apps/bullet-verifier`) reconstructs the
candidate in a clean room and returns typed gate outcomes. `crates/effects`
(`apps/bullet-effects`) is the effect broker and state machine over
`LocalBareForge`; ambiguous loss stays `unknown` until reconciled. Its bounded
on-disk queue persists `PENDING` and `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`, and the local daemon can
settle an unknown only as `QUARANTINED`, never as forge success. The Jeryu
adapter is a typed quarantine. These are isolated component boundaries.
There is no admitted live provider dispatch, online-authorized BulletGit
mutation, or connected runner -> BulletGit -> independent verifier -> effect
transaction, so none supplies production Evidence or integration truth.

Runner finalization (`crates/runner/src/attempt/drive/finalize.rs`) requires a
positive termination acknowledgement and recorded Candidate preservation before
one `Succeeded` release, followed by receipt-bound cleanup. A finalization error
reports `FINALIZATION_UNRESOLVED` with recovery subjects and prevents a second
fallback release. This does not establish termination of native descendants,
capacity retention beyond legacy lease expiry, atomic quota/verifier settlement,
or cleanup replay after a lost response.

Turn acceptance (`crates/runner/src/attempt/session.rs`) bounds the stream at
4,096 events and selects a close event matching both Bullet session and invocation.
It requires `Some(0)` exit, no timeout, and `TurnCompleted` before decoding or
applying a proposal. For a bounded failed turn, `session/failure.rs` retains the
close payload and turn facts as a content-addressed, private
`failed-turn-<digest>.json` with `FAILED_RUN_ARTIFACT_ONLY` disposition, then
refuses proposal acceptance; retention errors also refuse. This is a failed-run
artifact, not a successful Attempt. The Claude adapter preserves original compose
evidence before projecting its session binding and retains native invocation and
outcome facts, including the original close kind.

## Runner ↔ farmd lease admission refusal

`apps/bullet-runner/src/main.rs` returns typed
`LEASE_TRANSPORT_ADMISSION_UNAVAILABLE` when explicit lease inputs are absent or
invalid. With an absolute socket/recovery path, farmd UID and socket GID it
constructs `SignedLeaseRpcClient::new_admitted` and loads durable acquire recovery.
The CLI separately admits the Candidate request digest and verification key;
provider admission is decided before any of it. The dormant unsigned `HttpLeaseClient` uses the
operator `/api/v1` prefix, but its lease and advance routes are deliberately not
mounted and the product CLI never constructs it. This prevents a retired `/v1`
response or a public browser route from being mistaken for workload authority.

The committed predecessor (`419d8a6`, V1-S4) is a quarantined signed
lease-transport contract: `crates/harness-core/src/lease_transport.rs`
defines a PASETO v4.public permit with audience `lease-runner`, footer purpose
`lease-transport-signing`, implicit assertion
`bullet-farm.lease-transport.v1alpha1`, one named operation (`acquire`,
`heartbeat`, `advance`, `release`, `readback`) bound to one request digest;
`crates/application/src/lease_transport.rs` (`SignedLeaseService`) verifies a
permit and then applies one ledger operation or returns the last grant for a
lost acquire response. Its `last_acquire` index is process-local (readback
after a restart is `UNKNOWN`), its nonce ledger is in-memory, permit issuance
exists only under `test-seams` (`issue_permit`), and `crates/runner/src/
signed_lease.rs` (`SignedLeaseClient`, `test-seams` only) co-locates the
signing key with the verifier, which makes it a simulator, never an admission
path. `DirectLeaseClient` remains unsigned and test/embedded-only. A newer
internal UDS predecessor keeps the signing key in farmd, persists grants/nonces,
binds the connected Runner UID and registered Runner ID/epoch with `SO_PEERCRED`,
and makes the client pin the farmd UID plus socket group/device/inode. Its
registry and key can now be loaded from protected durable local files through
`apps/bullet-farmd/src/main/launch.rs`; the debug fixture remains a separate path.
The admitted client persists acquire intent/read-back metadata in its recovery
file. farmd exits if the lease listener fails. These consumed components do not
qualify production custody or a subscription Runner. No public `/api/v1/leases`
route is remounted, and this closes no five-plane gate.

## Scaffolds

`crates/router`, `crates/fusion`, and `crates/behavior` are non-authoritative
and non-gating. `crates/projections` holds the §25 `View`/`Surface` types only;
the served projections are described above under Projections. `crates/mcp-mock`
and `crates/test-simulation` exist for the contract lane only.

Content-addressed artifact storage is not implemented.
